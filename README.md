# Smart Studio
For the individual project during the fourth semester for the module Electronic Design Realization EN2160, I opted to enhance a Smart LED studio lighting system, primarily tailored for videographers, photographers, and professionals seeking improved lighting solutions. I began with an economical base product, featuring an ESP32 microcontroller. Following a user-centric design methodology, I aimed to rectify existing market deficiencies, introducing heightened luminosity, flexibility, and user-oriented attributes. This specialized lighting system not only targets the need for efficient workspace illumination but also offers stress relief and entertainment, effectively integrating practicality and leisure. The project's objective is to provide an affordable yet comprehensive lighting solution, thereby reshaping the landscape of studio lighting.
