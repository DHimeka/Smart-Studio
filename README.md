# Smart LED Studio Light System

For the individual project during the fourth semester for the module Electronic Design Realization EN2160, I opted to enhance a Smart LED studio lighting system, primarily tailored for videographers, photographers, and professionals seeking improved lighting solutions. I began with an economical base product, featuring an ESP32 microcontroller. Following a user-centric design methodology, I aimed to rectify existing market deficiencies, introducing heightened luminosity, flexibility, and user-oriented attributes. This specialized lighting system not only targets the need for efficient workspace illumination but also offers stress relief and entertainment, effectively integrating practicality and leisure. The project's objective is to provide an affordable yet comprehensive lighting solution, thereby reshaping the landscape of studio lighting.

## Introduction

Welcome to the Smart LED Studio Light System project! As a passionate photographer and videographer, I often found myself in need of high-quality studio lighting that didn't break the bank. This project was born out of that necessity, aiming to provide an affordable, customizable, and user-friendly studio lighting solution. In this `README.md`, I'll guide you through the project and share my journey in creating this versatile lighting system.

## Problem Statement

In my photography and videography work, I encountered the challenge of finding studio lighting that met my specific needs without costing a fortune. The existing commercial solutions were either too expensive or lacked the flexibility and features I desired. This project addresses this issue by offering an accessible DIY alternative that empowers creators to tailor their lighting setup.

## Design Approach

My design approach focused on three key pillars: affordability, versatility, and user-friendliness. To achieve these goals, I conducted thorough research on LED technology, lighting design principles, and user preferences. I also sought inspiration from the maker community, drawing on their creative solutions and feedback to refine my own design.

## Prototype Design

In the early stages, I carefully selected components, considering factors such as LED panel types, power sources, and control interfaces. The prototype development involved creating a functional LED panel design, crafting schematics, and performing initial testing. The insights gained from these initial prototypes allowed me to iterate and refine the design.

## Final Design

The final design of the Smart LED Studio Light System incorporates feedback from fellow photographers and videographers. I enhanced the system by adding Bluetooth connectivity, enabling users to control the lights remotely via a smartphone app. Additionally, I implemented a music visualization feature that synchronizes the lights with audio, creating dynamic and captivating lighting effects. The improved enclosure design ensures durability and aesthetic appeal.


## Suppliers

I sourced the components from reputable suppliers, ensuring the quality and reliability of the materials.

## Assembly Instructions

I've provided detailed step-by-step instructions to help you assemble your Smart LED Studio Light System.Since the device compromises of 2 PCBs
when assembling the device should be concerned about the connecting procedures.
-Power off the switch
-Place the batteries in the battery holder
-Confirm if the appropriate voltages are at headers J20 and J31 using a multi meter, before moving forward.Connect power to ESP and connect
power to the LED panel by connecting appropriate pins
-Connect the signal pins to LED Panel(header P10 in main PCB and P1 header in LED panel PCB)
-Press the power on switch and you can witness the functioning.

## Future Improvements

While the current version of the Smart LED Studio Light System is feature-rich, there are always opportunities for further enhancements. Some ideas for future improvements include:
- Integration with voice assistants for hands-free control.
- Compatibility with a wider range of music sources and platforms.
- Advanced color temperature and brightness presets for different shooting scenarios.
- Collaborative features for synchronized lighting setups in group settings.
